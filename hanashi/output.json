However, right when Kazuhisa was about to succeed in his revenge, a sudden earthquake throws his plans out of whack! Caught unaware, all he can do is patiently lie in wait until someone lumbering across the path happens to fall into his trap.

That’s not going to be as easy as it seems, however, as he’s not the only one to have been wrapped up in this mess…",

        "description": "It was August, and the “Blue Moon” had come around – a phenomenon wherein two full moons appear in the same month.\r\n\r\nAs a seventeen-year-old, I found myself in Arashiyama, Kyoto, at my grandmother’s house for a somber funeral. It was on this solemn occasion that a peculiar encounter awaited me. Under the radiant light of the first full moon, I stumbled upon a mysterious sight. There before me was a young girl, gracefully using an umbrella to scoop water from a spring, her actions illuminated by the moon’s ethereal glow.\r\n\r\nShe said, “I’ll be here until the Blue Moon ends,” and despite our same ages, she had a mysterious aura about her, as if hiding a great secret.\r\n\r\nThat secret was that “I’ve been waiting for you in the future.”\r\n\r\nThis is a love story stretching across time and space, depicting two people bound by fate.",
