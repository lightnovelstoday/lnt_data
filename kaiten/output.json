        "description": "JOIN THESE CUTE—BUT OVERPOWERED—GIRLS ON A GACHA FANTASY IN ANOTHER WORLD!\n\nAfter reaching the royal capital, Heihachi's party had a pretty rough time. First they fought in the arena after their mage, Estel, picked a fight with the hotheaded hottie, Dhius. Then, they farmed for Magigems day in and day out, not resting for a moment. So, is it finally time for them to take a break? No, the only breaking going on is the guild breaking the news that the party's gotta raise their rank or there'll be trouble—trouble for the guild, that is! Roll with the party as they do some Rank Up Quests, earning them access to a shiny new dungeon. Maybe they'll even answer the age-old question... Is it wrong to roll for pick up girls for a dungeon?",

A bona-fide faux-cave!\n\nIf he can make it so the only way in or out of the frontier is blocked off by a deadly cavern, then our reluctant hero knows Omui will be safe until it's in a better position to defend itself! But to create this decoy deathtrap, he's gonna need to line it with the most ridiculous deterrents he can think of. And for once, just once, this lackadaisical loner decides he could use a little help from his friends!\n\nWhat will they cook up? How will the test it? And just who else might be setting envious eyes upon the frontier's bounty? ",

        "description": "Ryugasaki-san is a lizardgirl. Her tongue is like that of a chameleon's, her hands are like that of a gecko's, and she even has a third eyelid!\n \nDue to her unique biological makeup, she sheds her skin multiple times a year. This wouldn't ordinarily be an issue, but she suddenly finds herself (or rather, her skin) the target of a classmate's affections.\n\nThe peculiar Yugami-kun has a particular interest in reptiles, and Ryugasaki-san's unique physiological features have caught his inquisitive, meticulous eye. Thus begins the story of a budding romance between two very unusual individuals. With a bit of luck, Ryugasaki-san can show the hapless Yugami-kun that there's more to her than her reptilian anatomy!",

Strange feelings have begun stirring in his chest.\n\nHe thought the only thing he loved about her was her skin, but what if... just what if... there's more to it than that?\n\nThus continues the daily hijinks of a lizardgirl and the oddball she pines for! Ryugasaki-san hasn't given up on pursuing the boy she loves, and Yugami-kun may well be taking notice.\n\nCan love bloom between an increasingly eccentric reptilian girl and the woefully degenerate boy who's obsessed with her cast-off skin? Only time can tell!",

        "description": "Blundering into battle with the bordering barony, the Bottom-Tier Baron continues his rise to the top!\r\n\r\nThanks to the misunderstandings of his subjects, Baron Rize has maxed out his approval rating. Next on the agenda? Bouncing back business in the Barony of Babalon! His secret scheme was to counterfeit specialty products from neighboring Barony of Bonclair, beginning a bootleg bonanza. However, Baron Zhaikov has caught on and declared war! Rize's number one priority is safety-specifically for number one: himself.\r\nSo he goes to battle with the sleazebag strategy of using his adoring subjects as meat shields. But thanks to even more misunderstandings, their loyalty to him continues to skyrocket!\r\nCan he ride this accidental, electric moral and snatch victory from the jaws of his foe?!",

        "description": "After the tragic loss of her mother, Misha Takanashi had all but shut herself away from the world. Her father desperately tried to hire new maids in order to take care of her and the housework while he’s busy with his own job, but it was to no avail as she manages to run them out of the position — all of them except one.\n\nBefore she knows it, Misha finds herself the center of attention of one Kamoi Tsubame, an eccentric ex-JSDF master sergeant who isn’t fazed in the slightest by Misha’s attempts to drive her away. Enamored by the adorable little girl, Tsubame makes it her personal goal to get Misha to open up her heart to her (and maybe even get her to wear the cute clothes she makes as well.)\n\nWhile her intentions are (mostly) good, Tsubame has a habit of taking things to the extreme when it comes getting closer to Misha, leading to all sorts of crazy situations that exasperate her to no end. Now, the pressure is on as Misha tries to find a way to deal with a maid who’s just way too annoying! ",

Unfortunately, things haven't been going so well for his former party during his absence, so his old partner, Katie, shows up to try to convince him to rejoin their ranks.\n\nHowever, Dennis has found new purpose in feeding the wayward souls that stop by his restaurant, and while he's given up on becoming the strongest adventurer, he takes great pride in his work as a chef.
