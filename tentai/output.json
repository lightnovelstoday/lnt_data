Slowly, but surely, he’s finally getting through to the frigid Fuyuka Himuro—a girl aptly nicknamed “The Ice Queen” for her standoffish attitude—and melting her icy exterior.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of it all, two hearts inch closer, inciting a tangible change—not only in Fuyuka’s personal life, but even at school.\r\n\r\nThis is the second volume of a slow-paced love story where characters experience the double-edged nature of romance. From laughs, to tears, to everything in between, these two will gradually learn how to convey their emotions properly.",

You’re just so adorable, bro.”\r\nIt’s been a month since I’ve started dating Haruka, my first ever girlfriend. We even finally reached first base today—holding hands! \r\n“What a bad boyfriend you are. To think you’re daydreaming about your little sister while you’re holding hands with your girlfriend, of all people!”\r\nToday’s also special for a different reason—my dad’s getting remarried, which means I get a new stepsister. Her name is Shigure, and she’s pretty much the spitting image of Haruka. That’s no surprise though, given that she’s actually Haruka’s long-lost twin sister! Due to family circumstances, they were split up at birth.\r\n“It’s okay, bro. I look exactly like sis does, right down to… well, you know. I don’t blame you at all.”\r\nHer presence adds a new, twisted form of love that tangles itself into our protagonist’s passionate love life! He can’t possibly tell his girlfriend what’s been going on!\r\nBe sure to check out this saucy romcom with a raunchy and rather needy stepsister!\r\nHer mother remarried, which makes her Hiromichi’s new stepsister. She was separated from her twin sister, Haruka, due to family circumstances. She changed schools in order to enroll into a very prestigious college, just like Hiromichi, so they’re in the same advanced class. She’s friendly to him at school, but at home, she constantly pushes his buttons until she’s had her fill.",

        "description": "A light novel series that center around the daily lives of Ike Touka and Tomoki Yuuji, who agree to a fake relationship. This series is one of Japan’s newest romcom sensations. It’s managed to garner not only the attention of many readers, but also their praise. You, too, can look forward to an unexpected story development and a great set of illustrations provided by Tomari-sensei.\r\n \r\nI’m Tomoki Yuuji—just your standard, run-of-the-mill high school student. I also happen to be faking a relationship with Ike Touka, the school’s newest queen bee. While everyone’s afraid of me and avoid me like the plague, Touka’s always trying to grab their attention whenever possible. It’s so the whole school knows we’re the “real deal,” I guess.\r\nThere are people who understand my situation and aren’t scared of me. There’s the actual protagonist of this story, Ike Haruma, or one of my teachers, Makiri Chiaki. But other than them and a few others, my situation hasn’t really changed ever since I started “going out” with Touka.\r\nOne of the people who remains very suspicious about my relationship with her is Haruma’s childhood friend, Kana. One day, she suddenly tells me to meet her alone. When I do, she blurts out something totally unexpected:\r\n“I’m so sorry, but could we start as friends and see how things go from there?!”\r\n…Wait a sec, did she just confess her feelings and reject me at the same time?!\r\nFind out what happens to Yuuji in the second volume of ‘There’s no way a side character like me could be popular, right?’!",

All I need to do is finish my finals, and then I’ll be free.\r\nIke’s invited me and Touka on the student council’s annual summer trip. Between that and Kana’s constant advances—even after I turned her down—it doesn’t look like things will be calming down this summer, that’s for sure!\r\nOh yeah—Makiri-sensei’s also joining us on the trip. She’s been acting pretty weird lately. \r\nAfter I talk to her, I find out that she’s apparently concerned about a marriage interview her father’s set up for her. I owe her a lot, and I worry for her just as much as she does for me. Isn’t there anything I can do to help her out?\r\nThat’s when we have a real heart-to-heart. If only she could truly fall in love with someone at least once! But who could that “someone” be? It’s definitely not me, right? Right…?\r\nFind out what happens in the third volume of the popular romcom, There’s no way a side character like me could be popular, right?",

        "description": "A highly popular school romantic comedy returns with its 4th installment, featuring an exciting swimsuit episode!\r\n\r\nAfter the events that unfold with Makiri-sensei, my summer vacations aren't over just yet. Normally I'd stay in my own home enjoying the AC, like I usually do every other year. However, this year, I find myself accompanying Ike Haruma, the protagonist of my story, as his loyal sidekick on a trip to the beach. Funnily enough, we end up stumbling our paths with Touka, Kana, and Tatsumiya over there. It all feels like the ideal summer experience, but do I really have the right to enjoy something like this? I'm just a side character, after all.\r\n\r\nAs the summer draws to a close, time passes swiftly, and the relationship between me and the other girls changes slowly but surely.\r\n\r\nGet ready for the 4th installment of this school romantic comedy, where Tomoki, our side character, will have to face new challenges and embarrassing situations! This is also the beach episode, so look forward to it!",

He doesn’t think much of it, though, as he was dying to use his level 99 cooking skills anyway. That’s why he decides to leave the city behind and open up a diner in the countryside.\r\nWhile pursuing his dream, Dennis meets Atrielle, a girl exiled from her noble household and relegated to slavery until he saves her.\r\nThe pair open the diner together, and their first client is… an exiled knight from a different guild? How peculiar. But she is not the only customer; a cocky mage and a drastically overworked yet underpaid sage become regulars as well.\r\nThe knight brings trouble to the diner at times, but Dennis’s cooking skills and beloved butcher knives cut through trouble and hunger alike!\r\nThus begins the legend of Dennis and his diner, the talk of the town!",

This doesn’t mean all that attention is good, though, as both Nobles and Professors alike decide to keep a closer eye on them.\r\n\r\nFor this same reason, a new young woman decides to rely on Sirius and the siblings to voice her problems: Lise. What will their repercussions of their meeting be?!\r\n\r\n“I care about how you feel regarding this matter, Lise. Nothing else. Leave it all to me, okay?”",

One day, he suddenly receives an expected invitation from Shiramori.\r\n\r\n“Why don’t we try going on a date?”\r\n\r\nThey walked through the streets, sat next to each other on the train, and toured the various stores around the station, slowly learning sides that only lovers show eachother.\r\n\r\n“It was written all over your face. ‘I’m so blessed to be able to go on a date with Kasumi!’”\r\n\r\nEven though they’re dating now, the teasing never stops in the second volume of this sickeningly sweet youth romantic comedy following Kuroya and his flirtatious senpai!",
