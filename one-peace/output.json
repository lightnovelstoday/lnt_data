        "description": "Nitta, our young and upcoming yazuka, has finally begun to grow accustomed to living with—and often being pushed around by—Hina, the little girl with psychokinetic powers who (practically) takes over his life. But then another psychokinetic girl suddenly appears! Her name is Anzu, and unlike Hina, she loves a good fight. After annihilating a biker gang, Anzu begins searching for Hina and stirring up all kinds of trouble along the way. When Nitta learns of Anzu and her intentions, he comes up with a plan to stop her, but could it actually work?! Prepare to be assaulted by uncontrollable fits of laughter when a battle of supernatural powers ensues and Nitta’s life spins further out of control! The massively popular Hitomi also makes an appearance in a never-before-seen extra chapter!",

It has been some time since Hina first used her immense powers to threaten Nitta and claim a spot in his home—settling into her new life in modern Japan and spending most of her time lazing about. But now, something seems to have changed. First, Hina’s inner hard-rockin’ spirit begins to thrash out. Then, she gets herself involved in the world of shady lending. And finally, she starts . . . taking lessons in social etiquette and the arts? What on earth has gotten into this girl?! Also revealed in this volume is Hina’s mysterious classmate, Sayo Aizawa—until now just a strange presence appearing in occasional panels.",

With the situation already too far out of control for any one of our heroes to grapple with, the only option is to band together—literally.\n\nJoin Hina, Anzu, and Mao as they tap into their inner rebel, turning their all-new girl group into an underground sensation that just might have the momentum to make Rockllusion a real phenomenon. Nitta and Hitomi are helping out behind the scenes, smoothing out their differences as they prepare to take the corporate world by storm. And back at the Nitta residence, NITTA VER 4.0 is officially part of the family, and he’s about to try his hand at duties outside the home.\n\nMeanwhile, enjoy catching up with some long-absent but not-forgotten favorites, including bartender Utako, who shares a brief glimpse of her life outside work, and tough-as-nails yakuza Naito, whose earnest attempt to reconnect with his son Hitoshi goes horribly awry.\n\nAre Hina and friends too late to thwart the bleak future ahead?

He's got two extra souls packed into his mind: Sanai Oka, a miserly samurai, and Masaharu Oka, a high school otaku who loves animal ears. Bard, who saved the royal family from cholera and received a noble title, visits the neighboring kingdom of Sanjuan on the orders of King Welkin. But what awaits this newly-minted diplomat in Sanjuan is an ugly battle of succession to determine the next king, triggered by the death of the king's eldest son. Now Bard must turn to his trusty cheats to save the kingdom from being torn apart by family turmoil!",

In the third volume of this epic series, he encounters new friends and foes. A powerful threat revels herself in the midst of an epic battle. A new companion with a penchant for magical birds, and tied to the royal family, appears at his side. And once again we find Naofumi plotted against, set up, and betrayed. Will Naofumi escape his pursuers and help the poor people of this strange world? Or is he forever doomed by the aggression that threatens to overcome him from all sides—and from within?",

Making the most of his newfound abilites, Usato aids the injured and heals the wounded, but danger lies just around the corner for his friends, Suzune and Kazuki!\n\nThe two heroes ﬁnd themselves face to face with the Demon Lord army’s black knight, a foe equipped with a terrifying, ominous suit of dark armor that’s seemingly impenetrable to any and all attacks. When their efforts amount to nothing, Suzune and Kazuki are left with their backs against the wall—the black knight’s blade getting ever closer.\n\nTo save his friends, Usato will have to make healing magic his weapon and use it the “wrong” way to topple this ostensibly invincible foe.",

Usato meets a young healer, Nack, and discovers that he is bullied for no other reason than his healing magic.

To save Nack and defend the honor of healers, Usato makes a bold decision―he’s going to teach Nack the Rescue Team training method! It’s volume three of the hugely popular The Wrong Way to Use Healing Magic, and you won’t want to miss the spirit of the Rescue Team in action!",

In the RPG, Eumiella isn’t worth thinking about at first, but in the endgame content she returns as a hidden boss, complete with ridiculous stats that put her on par with even the game’s heroes.\r\n\r\nAfter being essentially abandoned by her parents at their family domain, the flames of Eumiella’s former gamer soul are ignited, and she takes to leveling, and leveling, and leveling, until...at the time of enrolling in the Royal Academy, she discovers that she is level 99. Though she’d originally planned to live a peaceful and discreet life, the game’s heroine and her love interests suspect that Eumiella is in fact the infamous Demon Lord.\r\n\r\nThese ridiculous powers invite all manner of trials and tribulations.\r\n\r\nSo begins the fantasy tale of a most powerful, evil hidden boss (who wishes she could just live a life of peace and quiet).",

Yumiella’s determined to learn how to properly manage Dolkness County, her family’s estate, but she soon finds there’s quite a lot of work that needs to be done. Decades of neglect from her parents have left the county in shambles, and now it’s up to her to whip things back into shape!\r\n\r\nYet, even beyond that, Yumiella’s life isn’t all fun and games. Back in the Royal Capital, a group of corrupt aristocrats have begun to push for the second prince, Prince Edwin, to succeed Valschein’s throne, and they appear to be planning something even more sinister behind the scenes...\r\n\r\nStill, whether she’s dealing with a mysterious shadow group or problems with her county, Yumiella will handle it in the same way she always does—by using her level 99 strength!",
