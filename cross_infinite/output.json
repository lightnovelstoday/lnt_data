So I shall gain the strength to survive here through my own efforts.” Alone and armed only with her resolve, Bertine flees the estate and begins to carve a path that will allow her to live in enemy territory…\r\nA young lady possessed of a hidden talent for business.

        "description": "When Respect Transforms into Love!\r\nUsing her courage and business savvy as weapons, Bertine earns more for the Federation than the reparations owed in her role discovering and marketing the country’s specialty products. The scarlet fabric, fruit jams and marmalades, spices, boats, and even a hotel… She shapes her ideas into reality one after another, ever expanding her businesses. The way she lives her life inspires and moves Cecilio deeply. But the general isn’t the only one affected as Bertine’s influence inadvertently spreads to the Empire’s second prince and even his uncle. All of which leads to political upheaval in the Kingdom of San Luenne, which scorned Bertine’s very existence. Thus the adventurous tale of a young lady who awakened to her potential in a new land reaches its rousing conclusion!",

Never expecting to see Euphemia again, he’s shocked to receive a job protecting the spunky researcher who just might be his lifelong mate.\r\nFollow Euphemia and Zelaide as they navigate a colony world brimming with peculiar beasts, powerful narcotics, dangerous criminals, and a budding, interspecies romance!\r\nWarning: Beast Blood contains action-packed Sci-Fi violence, attempted sexual assault, dark themes, steamy and sexy romance scenes, alien romance, and other trigger-worthy adult situations.",

    "description": "Cross Infinite World is excited to bring you emeth: Island of Golems, Grand Prize Winner of the 3rd Square Enix Novels’ Award, fully revised with new art by Mura Karuki and new scenes added by the authors for its first-ever English release! Co-authors Souki Tsukishima and Tora Tsukishima have served as writers for many epic games and novels, such as Final Fantasy Type 0 -The Last Truth-, Final Fantasy Agito, Imaginary Range, Root Double, Ingress the Animation, and more!\r\n“Creating Life”—such power is blasphemy against God.\r\nIn emeth’s world, the manufacturing of Golems—automatic dolls that move according to human will—has become the norm. This sets the stage for an epic adventure against the backdrop of St. Rollins Archipelago, where the Torah Church presides over all creation and operation of these Golems.\r\nStep into the story through the perspective of Cliff, a boy living in the slums of a Torah-controlled island who so fervently wants to become a Golem Tamer that he has begun to illegally build one. His mundane world is suddenly shattered one day when he crosses paths with a mysterious girl. This meeting sets the gears in motion for a thrilling journey involving powerful Golems, corruption, and the very fate of the island itself!\r\nAlso, check out this exclusive interview with emeth’s authors: HERE!",

Co-authors Souki Tsukishima and Tora Tsukishima have served as writers for many epic games and novels, such as Final Fantasy Type 0 -The Last Truth-, Final Fantasy Agito, Imaginary Range, Root Double, Ingress the Animation, and more!\r\n“Creating Life”—such power is blasphemy against God.\r\nIn emeth’s world, the manufacturing of Golems—automatic dolls that move according to human will—has become the norm. This sets the stage for an epic adventure against the backdrop of St. Rollins Archipelago, where the Torah Church presides over all creation and operation of these Golems.\r\nStep into the story through the perspective of Cliff, a boy living in the slums of a Torah-controlled island who so fervently wants to become a Golem Tamer that he has begun to illegally build one. His mundane world is suddenly shattered one day when he crosses paths with a mysterious girl. This meeting sets the gears in motion for a thrilling journey involving powerful Golems, corruption, and the very fate of the island itself!\r\nAlso, check out this exclusive interview with emeth’s authors: HERE!",

    "description": "A Supernatural Mismatch Made in Heaven\r\nParanormal incidents heat up when two mysterious men cross paths in Tomoe, a small town in Hiroshima with a long history of supernatural encounters.\r\nMisato Miyazawa is a strikingly beautiful young man with a troubled past. Born to a distinguished family of onmyoji—specialists in divination—Misato is no stranger to the occult. That’s why he jumps at the chance to join the Abnormal Disaster Unit in Tomoe’s Town Hall Crisis Management Division, a unit more commonly known as The Spirit Hunters.\r\nEnter Ryouji Karino, a fiery, handsome man with peculiar green and silver eyes. Working as a freelance monk and raised by a man claiming to be a tengu, Ryouji is by no means an average citizen. When he finds Misato in a sticky situation, he ‘kindly’ steps in, and the mismatched pair end up living together.\r\nWhat dark mysteries will unravel before them as they attempt to confront paranormal happenings under the constraints of government rules?",

        "description": "A Supernatural Mismatch Made in Heaven\r\nParanormal incidents heat up when two mysterious men cross paths in Tomoe, a small town in Hiroshima with a long history of supernatural encounters.\r\nMisato Miyazawa is a strikingly beautiful young man with a troubled past. Born to a distinguished family of onmyoji—specialists in divination—Misato is no stranger to the occult. That’s why he jumps at the chance to join the Abnormal Disaster Unit in Tomoe’s Town Hall Crisis Management Division, a unit more commonly known as The Spirit Hunters.\r\nEnter Ryouji Karino, a fiery, handsome man with peculiar green and silver eyes. Working as a freelance monk and raised by a man claiming to be a tengu, Ryouji is by no means an average citizen. When he finds Misato in a sticky situation, he ‘kindly’ steps in, and the mismatched pair end up living together.\r\nWhat dark mysteries will unravel before them as they attempt to confront paranormal happenings under the constraints of government rules?",

Yaeka Kamiki, the only high school student on the island, is a shrine maiden of Kamiki Shirahige Shrine. She serves the god Itsukigami, a deity who drifted to the shores of Kamiki Island from across the sea long ago. However, when freelance monk Ryouji Karino takes a fishing trip to the island on the day of the equinox, a colossal wave suddenly takes him captive and washes him away. As a government-appointed onmyoji, Misato Miyazawa steps up to find his missing friend—and senses the most peculiar, overwhelming presence coming from the sea itself…\r\nThis volume also includes “Shirota’s Great Escape,” an arc centering on everyone’s favorite snake spirit!",

    "description": "What Secrets Does The Magic Item Shop Hold?\r\nIn a kingdom where magic is strictly outlawed, a young sorcerer named Lille finds herself imprisoned in a tower for no reason other than simply existing. After ten years of being locked up, a huge, mythical bird suddenly appears on her windowsill to whisk her away. The bird—a familiar called Ark—takes her to a quaint little house, where he introduces her to his master, a sorcerer named Charles. Charles decides to take Lille on as his apprentice, alongside another young sorcerer named Leo. As her new life begins, Lille discovers what it means to have a family, and even what it means to fall in love. Through her shop-keeping duties at Charles’ Magic Item Shop, she gradually adjusts to life in the outside world. The more she learns, however, the more she finds herself wrapped up in Charles and Leo’s secrets…",

        "description": "The Truth About Mushrooms!\r\nAgnes has never thought much of herself or her troublesome ability to commune with divine spirits, which has plagued her life with randomly sprouting mushrooms. But now that Prince Claude has assured her of his love and acceptance, she’s started to regain some of the confidence and self-esteem that she lost during her long, painful engagement to her ex-fiancé.\r\nBut Claude isn’t just a prince—he’s a man who carries Dragon’s Blood in his veins, and as his Dragonmate Agnes has to come to terms with what that means for their relationship. Before she gets much of a chance though, a new mystery begins to unfold—a number of discrepancies come up regarding the tragic carriage accident that sent Agnes’ parents to their deaths.\r\nThe two lovers head off to the spring where Agnes’ parents first met, searching for answers, but find their efforts stymied when Agnes is kidnapped and spirited away to the neighboring country of Orielle! Trapped in a foreign land, Agnes is forced to confront the truth behind her divine power, even as she comes face-to-face with the country’s royal family.\r\nAnd when Prince Claude realizes Agnes has been taken from him, he just might develop a new power of his own…",

    "description": "What’s a Priestess to Do with Her Engagement Broken and Reputation in Tatters?!\r\nAs the only priestess on the frontlines in the war against monsters, Monica worked hard to fulfill her duties and her incredible power earned her a place by the crown prince’s side as his fiancée. Except that power came with an added nuisance—the ability to rouse the baser instincts of those affected! When the crown prince found out, he cursed her as a wanton priestess and ended their engagement. Naturally, the news of an indecent holy woman spread like wildfire throughout the nation. While Monica struggled to manage the upheaval in her life, Richard, a battle comrade, approached her with an offer.\r\n“Will you come to my country? My elder brother and his wife are in need of a priestess because they’re barren.”\r\nBut Monica didn’t know a crucial truth. He was the emperor’s younger brother! An effusive and sparklingly pure love story unfolds between an overly doting imperial prince and a workaholic priestess with an unfortunate talent!\r\n©Makino Maebaru 2022 / Illustration by Hachi Uehara",

Yet one day, Albert comes to Mary with a shocking proposal.\r\n“Will you marry me?”\r\nDespite being happy, Mary can’t make up her mind—not until she comes to terms with her past. Meanwhile, Queen Tia remains missing, but her sinister plans creep ever closer to upsetting the peace Mary craves!\r\n©Akako 2021 Illustration / Hazuki Futaba",

The day before her university entrance ceremony, Yuki’s father tells her he’s from another world, before throwing her off their condo’s balcony on the 14th floor.\r\nThe next thing she knows she’s rescued by the handsome Fourth Prince of Adolunde and forced into a contract with him. Yuki travels to the front lines of a war she knows nothing about to keep out of reach of the psychotic First Prince of Adolunde. He will go to any lengths to sacrifice her as the Legendary Witch she resembles.\r\nWhat will happen to Yuki? Will she revert to her true age and return home? Or will Adolunde’s first prince burn her at the stake?\r\nThe Violet Knight is one of the first Josei Japanese Light Novel series officially in English!",

        "description": "Yuki was just your average high school girl—that is, if you consider having violet eyes and not aging a day since her tenth birthday as average. The day before her university entrance ceremony, Yuki’s father tells her he’s from another world, before throwing her off their condo’s balcony on the 14th floor.\r\nThe next thing she knows she’s rescued by the handsome Fourth Prince of Adolunde and forced into a contract with him. Yuki travels to the front lines of a war she knows nothing about to keep out of reach of the psychotic First Prince of Adolunde. He will go to any lengths to sacrifice her as the Legendary Witch she resembles.\r\nWhat will happen to Yuki? Will she revert to her true age and return home? Or will Adolunde’s first prince burn her at the stake?\r\nThe Violet Knight is one of the first Josei Japanese Light Novel series officially in English!",

He is the only one to survive the retaliation of the Bakufu that had dubbed all that oppose them as Akuto.

Together they strive to keep their people fed and alive in a time of great suffering.\r\nWill Masayoshi and Saki be able to stay together in this war-torn world? Experience the final chaotic years marking the downfall of the Kamakura period (1330 A.D.) through the eyes of the people history deemed a nuisance in this historical romance manga!",
